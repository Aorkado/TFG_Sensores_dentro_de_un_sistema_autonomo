# LEDC Basic Test

This example was used to test how precise was the PWM signal created by the LEDC perypheral of the ESP32. The test was
simple: a sweep of the width. The frequency of the signal was 5 kHz and the maximum resolution was 13 bits. This data can
be extracted from the [LEDC Control documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html) of ESP32.
